Run The SQL Query is a fork of Run SQL Query plugin by Fabricio Carell. It's a simple plugin to quickly execute any type of SQL query into the WordPress's DB and export the results in a CSV format file.

## Description

This plugin will allow you to execute any type of SQL query into the WordPress's DB connecting through the driver provided by the MySQLi extension without the need to use another tool like phpMyAdmin.

It also gives you the ability to export the results in a CSV format file.

In order to access this plugin's admin page (Tools -> Run The SQL Query), your account needs to have the `install_plugins` capability, that means a Super Admin in the multi-site installation or an Admin in a single site.

Run The SQL Query is a fork of Run SQL Query plugin by Fabricio Carell. And it provides some extra control over plugin settings and configs.

## Added Features

* **Capability Settings.**
   One problem that I faced while using Run SQL Query plugin is, that the plugin uses plugin_installs capability to add the console page and my wp-config file had DISALLOW_FILE_MODS set to true which was messing up with the plugin_installs capability, so I added a settings page where you can choose the capability.
